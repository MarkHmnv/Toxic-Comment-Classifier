# Toxic Comment Classifier with BERT
This is a pet project that I created with the intention of enhancing my knowledge in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and TensorFlow.

## Introduction
A TensorFlow-based neural network model which uses the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is the [cleaned-toxic-comments](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fizzbuzz/cleaned-toxic-comments) dataset available on Kaggle.

## Requirements
* TensorFlow 2.x
* TensorFlow Hub
* Pandas
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* Kaggle API

## Example usage
This classifier could be useful in various applications such as pre-moderation of comments, automatic flagging of inappropriate content, and more.
